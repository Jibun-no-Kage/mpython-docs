Introduction
====================


MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

The mPython Board is a MicroPython microcontroller board with full support for software features, It's developed and designed for IoT.  
The hardware has: ESP-WROOM-32 dual-core chip that supports WiFi and BT，1.3" OLED display panel，3-axis Accelerometer，Geomagnetic, Sound, Light and Temperature Sensor, Buzzer, RGB LED, Touch Button, Push Switch, GPIO, Resistive Input Port and USB Type C. 

MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.

MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.
