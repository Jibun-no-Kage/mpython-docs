:mod:`ds18x20` --- ds18b20 Temperature sensor driver
==================================================

One wire bus is a serial bus that uses only one wire for communication (except the wires used for grounding and power supply). The DS18B20 temperature sensor is a very popular single-wire device with the characteristics of conpact, low hardware overhead, strong anti-interference ability, and high accuracy.

- Unique onewire (single bus) interface mode, DS18B20 only needs one port line to realize bidirectional communication between microprocessor and DS18B20 when connected with microprocessor.
- Temperature range －55℃～+125℃，
- Support multi-point networking function, multiple DS18B20s can be connected in parallel on the only three wires, and only a maximum of 8 can be connected in parallel to achieve multi-point temperature measurement. If the number is too large, the power supply voltage will be too low, resulting in stable signal transmission. 
- Power Supply: 3.0~5.5V/DC

    If you use a single ds18b20 device, in order to ensure stable data transmission, the OUT pin of the signal needs to be connected to a 4.7K pull-up resistor.

DS18X20 class
-------------

.. class:: DS18X20(onewire)

Create DS18X20 class。

- ``onewire`` - one wire object sample

.. method:: DS18X20.scan()

Scan the ds18b20 device on the single bus and return a list of device addresses.

.. method:: DS18X20.convert_temp()

Obtain temperature sampling for convert temperature unit conversion.

.. method:: DS18X20.read_temp(rom)

Returns the temperature value of the device. NOte that after ``convert_temp()`` converts the temperature, you need to wait at least 750 ms before reading the temperature value.

- ``rom`` - device address
