:mod:`onewire` --- Single Bus
====================================================

.. module:: onewire
    :synopsis: Single bus

Single bus is one-wire bus, which is the peripheral serial expansion bus technology launched by American DALLAS company.
Different from SPI and IÂ²C serial data communication methods. It uses a single signal line to transmit both clock and data, and the data transmission is bidirectional. It has many advantages such as saving I/O lines, simple resource structure, low cost, and easy bus expansion and maintenance.

The single bus is suitable for a single master system and can control one or more slave devices. The host can be a microcontroller, the slave can be a single bus device, the data exchange between them only through a signal line. 
When there is only one slave device, the system can operate as a single-node system; when there are multiple slave devices, the system operates as a multi-node system. Figure 12-1 shows a single bus multi-node system.
